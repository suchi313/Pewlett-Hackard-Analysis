# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
The main objective of this analysis was review the data given to us by Pewlett Hackard, conduct a database analysis using PostGreSQL, and provide results that showcased the # of future retirees across all departments that are currently employeed. The results aided the company in preparing a gameplan to hire and onboard new employees but also look into a mentorship opportunities for the tenured employees to mentor the new employees. 

Overall, throughout the course of the challenge we had to create 4 tables. Mentorship_Elgibility, Retirement_Titles, Retiring_Titles, and Unique_Titles.
The criteria for identify the retired employees was based off their birthdays and dates hired. The dates for birthday ranged from 1952-1955 and hired dates from 1985-1988.
